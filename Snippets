        <p> <strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-2s c1-2t c1-b c1-6q c1-32 c1-43 c1-8q">Negotiated settlement is always
                available and the early identification and mitigation of legal, financial and other risks arising from
                disputes saves costs and management time. However, there may come a time when informal or facilitated
                negotiations fail to build consensus in a dispute situation. This is usually the point at which the
                parties start to consider which alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process best suits their particular
                situation and which options are open to them.<span id="dots">...</span></strong></p>
